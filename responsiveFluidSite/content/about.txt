				<div id='chest' class="panel"><h1>Hey again,</h1><p>Hello I guess since you have made it this far it's time for me to introduce myself. My name is Loveson Joseph, but I usually go by LJ. I was born in a little town called <a href="http://www.cityoffortpierce.com/index.html" class="fade">Fort Pierce, FL</a>. As I grew up I liked technology anything from a <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/products/t-mobile-mytouch-4g/" class="fade">cell phone</a> to <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/products/mp3players/default.htm" class="fade" >music player</a>.The moment i realized that I would like to do web design was in my second year of college. For some reason I got more interested on what you can do with a computer rather then what a computer is composed of. Don't get me wrong I like to keep myself up to date with the newest computer <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/corei7/index.htm" class="fade" >parts</a>. The courses I began to in my information technology degree were focusing more on web work like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design" class="fade" >designs</a>. I guess this came about since I like to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing" class="fade" >draw</a> in my spare time so it was only natural that I wanted to take it, and combine it with the computer via software and code.</p><p> The excel <a href="http://excel.ucf.edu/" class="fade" >excel program</a> at had open spots for the undergraduate research program. I applied and was offered a position to assist in <a href="http://mmae.ucf.edu/" class="fade" >mechanical engineering department</a> to work with graduate students. The people I worked with could not fully use my help since the things they were working on was way over my head due to my current knowledge and experience. So one of the graduates propsed thought that I should come up with a website to display their current work progress in the lab. It sounded feasible ,but I never made a website before and so I had to figure out how to make a website and make it presentable. I used <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html" class="fade" >Adobe Dreamweaver</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite" class="fade" >Creative Suite 4</a> then I moved to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" class="fade" >Microsoft's</a> <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/product/related-technologies/pages/sharepoint-designer.aspx" class="fade" >SharePoint designer</a>. Things turned out ok and my <a href="http://mmae.ucf.edu/Faculty/CXu.html" class="fade" >supervisor</a> was impressed with my work. The only thing that I wished happened was that she used my <a href="http://www.lovesonjoseph.com/p?id=projects.php#rise" class="fade" >work</a>.</p><p> After this job I applied to other parts of the campus, and got many offers. But I decided to accept the one that was actually an <a href="http://it.sdes.ucf.edu/?id=home" class="fade" >information technology department</a> where they had <a href="http://it.sdes.ucf.edu/?id=contacts" class="fade" >development, technician, and infrastructure teams</a>. I felt that I would learn a lot of useful skills for the future, and to this day I am still learning from them. I am serving as web designer assistant in which I do content management, small design projects, and some application development for our development team when things get busy. Overall it's been a long journey to get here and I am glad that I have got this far, and I am always ready to learn new things and share ideas that I have. So far the things I have experience with are building websites with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" class="fade" >HTML</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" class="fade" >CSS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" class="fade" >XML</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" class="fade" >MySQL</a>, and <a href="http://www.php.net/" class="fade" >PHP</a>. I have used <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="fade" >Microsoft office</a>, SharePoint designer, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite.html" class="fade" >Adobe Creative Suite 5</a>(Photoshop, Dreamweaver, illustrator, and flash). I have done websites for departments and also some freelance work for friends. My process of creating a website has changed from just making the website page as I think it should look.</p><br/><span class="stepstitle">My website process:</span><ol><li>Now my way starts with a long conversation of what the person wants.</li><li>I then ask them to show me sites that have the features that they want. </li><li>After this I draw the look of the pages so that I can show the client so that they can agree or disagree. <br/><img src="drawing.png" alt="" class="stepimg" /></li><li>I then begin coding if things are accepted <br/><img src="coding.png" alt="" class="stepimg" /></li><li>After coding the functional part I add the design features</li><li>After that is done I add the content to the site <br/><img src="content.png" alt="content" class="stepimg" /></li><li>When the content is added I do a quick walk through of the site (optimize code, optimize images, organize the files ,and give them folders and names).</li></ol><p>Now why did i create this website? Well Ive always wanted to show my work to everyone, but i have so many versions. So this newly created site will have my latest work in one centralized location. Now that you know a little bit more of go to my ask me page and submit a question or just tell me about you.</p><div id="resume"><p>By the way for those who are interested here is my resume(for your convenience in .doc and .pdf):</p><div id="word"><a href="resume.doc" title="MSWORD"><img src="Word.png" alt="" /></a></div><div id="adobe" title="PDF"><a href="resume.pdf"><img src="adobe.png" alt="" /></a></div><div id="vcf" title="VCF"><a href="lovesonjoseph.vcf"><img src="vcf2.png" alt="" /></a></div></div></div>
