My name is Loveson Joseph or better known as "LJ", and my I have come to love web designing. I have created many different sites and I want the world to see my work. This website has almost every concept that I have ever learned. Not only that but this site has a few extra treats for the public. This is my first personal website so please have a look around and constructive criticism is always welcome.

So you probably want to see the work that I have done in the past. Well look below and knock yourself out. Some of these projects were currently created and others created a couple years back.

I know there are a lot of you who have questions, comments, or concerns. Well this is the place to do it. I promise the information that you provide me will not be used maliciously. Also I will answer your questions as soon as possible. Note: stupid questions will get erased or get stupid answers…..
